	<tr>
	<td><strong>Overview:</strong></td>
	<td>A program which allows you to refresh any web page of your choosing. This program will allow you to sit back on your computer and let this program run in the background and refresh all the pages and notifies you when a webpage has been updated. This will allow you to not have to refresh the page when you want to refresh it. This is helpful when you are busy doing something and your hands are busy doing something else. The program can have multiple URL links and you can also have a timer on how long the program will refresh the page for you</td>

	<tr>
	<td><strong>Motivation:</strong></td>
	<td>The motivation behind this project idea is to help others that are expecting some sort of news or any updates on a website or even multiple websites. I would like to have a program to be created which allows you to do other things while the program refreshes for you. This is because we do not know when the website will be updated so a person does not have to be at the computer all day pressing the F5 key are clicking on the refresh button on the website, making it easier for everyone to not have to do this.</td>
  </tr>
	
   <tr>
	<td><strong>Description:</strong></td>
	<td>When you open up the program. It will ask you for your email address and/or phone number so that the program can then alert you when required. The program will ask for URL links that you would like to enter. You then copy the URL links into a box. Once you have inserted all of the URL links you wanted, you would be asked to set a refresh timer on and for how long this program would like to last. For example, you can insert two weblinks and have the program refresh one weblink every 10 seconds lasting for one week while the other refreshes for one hour lasting fifty-two weeks. The program will then refresh those weblinks at each increment for the duration you have set. Once a page has been updated. The program will send you a notification saying that a URL link you have chosen has been updated and will give you the link for you to then click on to. The program also allows you to add and remove the ‘jobs’ whenever you like and you are even able to edit the increments and the duration whenever you like. The program will run in the background and will not disturb you until a webpage has been updated. The program will stop refreshing a page when the URL link becomes invalid, the duration of the set time runs out or when the user wants it to cancel it. This program will remember every URL link that you have entered and may suggest you URL links that you may like to kept inform.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td><strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong></td>
	<td>The program will need to written up by a programing language that the computer can support. This will require the computer to be updated and have a recent operating system that allows to run this program. </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td><strong>Skills required:</strong></td>
	<td>This will require really complex coding and up-to-date resources to make sure the links are up and running. It will require a lot of people to work together on making sure that the code can work consistently on all sorts of website links and make sure that it refreshes for you.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td><strong>Outcome:</strong></td>
	<td>If this project is successful. Then people will be able to stay informed on what has changed on the URL links that they have selected. This will then help people by not having people refresh pages all of the time to find out in something new was even going to happen soon let alone if something will even change.</td>
