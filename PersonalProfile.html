	<td><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong></td>
	<td>The test results don’t really mean anything to me because I might have different answers as I grow up and will have the results changed because of the changes of me growing up. I take the results with a grain of salt and not pay that much attention to it. This is because I expected the results that I had received. It is nothing special for me at least.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></td>
	<td>Other people in the team might find them useful and learn from it but my behaviour stays the same when I am working alone or in a team. The results have no influence on me what so ever. The results mean very little to me at least.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></td>
	<td>When forming a team, we need to have a balance of all different types of people so that when a situation arises then. The team is able to sort out the problem and create a solution to then not make the same problem. Balance of people is vital when it comes to team making. I prefer having a well-balanced team that takes their time and shows their work and co-operate with each other than a team that just rushes everything and argues with everything and doesn’t settle any arguments.</td>
