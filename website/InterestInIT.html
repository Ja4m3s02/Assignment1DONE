    <td>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</td>
    <td>Well, I don’t have a particular set of interests in particular when it comes to IT. I just enjoy dealing with computers and helping people that may have problems in the IT side of things. My interest is deriving from helping people with technology. For me, being interested in IT is a different feeling than what I normally have from being interested in other things. I can’t really say what specific time my interest in IT started since it grew from a young age and I just got interested in IT and grew more as I grew up.</td>

There was no exact reason why I chose to come to RMIT, I just felt like it was a great place to learn from.</td>
